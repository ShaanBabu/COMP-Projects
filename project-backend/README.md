## 0. Aims:

1. Demonstrate effective use of software development tools to build full-stack end-user applications.
2. Demonstrate effective use of static testing, dynamic testing, and user testing to validate and verify software systems.
3. Understand key characteristics of a functioning team in terms of understanding professional expectations, maintaining healthy relationships, and managing conflict.
4. Demonstrate an ability to analyse complex software systems in terms of their data model, state model, and more.
5. Understand the software engineering life cycle in the context of modern and iterative software development practices in order to elicit requirements, design systems thoughtfully, and implement software correctly.
6. Demonstrate an understanding of how to use version control, continuous integration, and deployment tooling to sustainably integrate code from multiple parties.

## 1. Overview

UNSW needs a change in business model. Revenue has been going down, despite the absolutely perfect MyExperience feedback.

When doing some research, UNSW found the video game industry industry, particularly mobile games like Candy Crush earn over $500 million each year.

UNSW has tasked me (Hayden), and my army of COMP1531 students with investigating the possibility of recreating this game, for UNSW profit.

Only one thing stands in the way...

Microsoft recently bought Candy Crush, and they also own UNSW's only communication platform, **<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a>**!

If we want to make a Candy Crush competitor, we're going to have to remake Teams first - or those Microsoft spies will shut us down before we even begin development!

The 22T2 cohort of COMP1531 students will build the **backend Javascript server** for a new communication platform, **UNSW Treats** (or just **Treats** for short). I plan to task future COMP6080 students to build the frontend for Treats, something you won't have to worry about.

**UNSW Treats** is the questionably-named communication tool that allows you to share, communicate, and collaborate virtually *without* intervention from Microsoft spies.

I have already specified a **common interface** for the frontend and backend to operate on. This allows both courses to go off and do their own development and testing under the assumption that both parties will comply with the common interface. This is the interface **you are required to use**.

The specific capabilities that need to be built for this project are described in the interface at the bottom. This is clearly a lot of features, but not all of them are to be implemented at once.

Good luck, and please don't tell anyone at Microsoft about this. üòä

(For legal reasons, this is a joke).

## 2. Iteration 0: Getting Started

Complete!

## 3. Iteration 1: Basic Functionality and Tests

Complete!

## 4. Iteration 2: Building a Web Server

Complete!

## 5. Iteration 3: Completing the Lifecycle

Iteration 3 builds off all of the work you've completed in iteration 2.

If you haven't completed the implementation of iteration 2, you must complete it as part of this iteration. The automarking for iteration 3 will test on a fully completed interface.

### 5.1. Task

In this iteration, you are expected to:

1. Make adjustments to your existing code and tests as per any feedback given by your tutor for iteration 2. In particular, you should take time to ensure that your code is well-styled and complies with good software writing practices and software and test design principles discussed in lectures.

2. Implement and test the HTTP Express server according to the entire interface provided in the specification, including features that were added in iteration 3.

    * Part of this section will be automarked.

    * It is required that your data is persistent, just like in iteration 2.

    * `eslint` is assessed identically to iteration 2.

    * Good coverage for all .ts files that aren't tests will be assessed: see section 5.4 for details.

    * You can structure your test files however you choose, as long as they are appended with `.test.ts`. You may place them inside a `/tests` folder, if you wish. For this iteration, we will only be testing your HTTP layer of tests. 

    * In iteration 2 and 3, we provide a frontend that can be powered by your backend: see section 6.8 for details. Note that the frontend will not work correctly with an incomplete backend. As part of this iteration, it is required that your backend code can correctly power the frontend.
      * You can, if you wish, make changes to the frontend code, but it is not required for this course.

    * You must comply with instructions laid out in `5.3`

    * Ensure that you correctly manage sessions (tokens) and passwords in terms of authentication and authorisation, as per requirements laid out in section 6.9.

3. Continue demonstrating effective project management and git usage.

    * You will be heavily marked on your thoughtful approach to project management and effective use of git. The degree to which your team works effectively will also be assessed.

    * As for iteration 1 and 2, all task tracking and management will need to be done via the GitLab Taskboard or other tutor-approved tracking mechanism.

    * As for iteration 1 and 2, regular group meetings must be documented with meeting minutes which should be stored at a timestamped location in your repo (e.g. uploading a word doc/pdf or writing in the GitLab repo wiki after each meeting).

    * As for iteration 1 and 2, you must be able to demonstrate evidence of regular standups.

    * You are required to regularly and thoughtfully make merge requests for the smallest reasonable units, and merge them into `master`.

4. Document the planning of new features.

    * You are required to scope out 2-3 problems to solve for future iterations of Treats. You aren't required to build/code them, but you are required to go through SDLC steps of requirements analysis, conceptual modelling, and design.

    * Full detail of this can be found in `5.6`.

5. Deploy your backend to the cloud.

    * You are required to deploy your backend to a cloud provider so that your backend can be accessed from anywhere in the world. **Add the URL to your deployed backend** inside `deploy-url.md`.

    * Full detail of this can be found in `5.7`

### 5.2. Running the server

To run the server, you can run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the port in the `src/server.ts` file, using `ts-node`.

If you get an OSError stating that the address is already in use, you can change the port number in `config.json` to any number from 1024 to 49151. Is it likely that another student may be using your original port number.

Please note: For routes such as `standup/start` and `message/sendlater`, you are not required to account for situations where the server process crashes or restarts while waiting. If the server ever restarts while these active "sessions" are ongoing, you can assume they are no longer happening after restart.

### 5.3. Implementing and testing features

Continue working on this project by making distinct "features". Each feature should add some meaningful functionality to the project, but still be as small as possible. You should aim to size features as the smallest amount of functionality that adds value without making the project more unstable. For each feature you should:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Write tests for that feature and commit them to the branch. These will fail as you have not yet implemented the feature.
3. Implement that feature.
4. Make any changes to the tests such that they pass with the given implementation. You should not have to do a lot here. If you find that you are, you're not spending enough time on your tests.
5. Create a merge request for the branch.
6. Get someone in your team who **did not** work on the feature to review the merge request. When reviewing, **not only should you ensure the new feature has tests that pass, but you should also check that the coverage percentage has not been significantly reduced.**
7. Fix any issues identified in the review.
8. Merge the merge request into master.

For this project, a feature is typically sized somewhere between a single function, and a whole file of functions (e.g. `auth.ts`). It is up to you and your team to decide what each feature is.

There is no requirement that each feature be implemented by only one person. In fact, we encourage you to work together closely on features, especially to help those who may still be coming to grips with Typescript.

Please pay careful attention to the following:

* We want to see **evidence that you wrote your tests before writing the implementation**. As noted above, the commits containing your initial tests should appear *before* your implementation for every feature branch. If we don't see this evidence, we will assume you did not write your tests first and your mark will be reduced.
* You should have black-box tests for all tests required (i.e. testing each function/endpoint). However, you are also welcome to write whitebox unit tests in this iteration if you see that as important.
* Merging in merge requests with failing pipelines is **very bad practice**. Not only does this interfere with your teams ability to work on different features at the same time, and thus slow down development, it is something you will be penalised for in marking.
* Similarly, merging in branches with untested features is also **very bad practice**. We will assume, and you should too, that any code without tests does not work.
* Pushing directly to `master` is not possible for this repo. The only way to get code into `master` is via a merge request. If you discover you have a bug in `master` that got through testing, create a bugfix branch and merge that in via a merge request.

### 5.4. Test coverage

To get the coverage of your tests locally, you will need to have two terminals open. Run these commands from the root directory of your project.

In the first terminal, run
```bash
npm run ts-node-coverage
```

In the second terminal, run jest as usual
```bash
npm run test
```

Back in the first terminal, stop the server with Ctrl+C or Command+C. There should now be a `/coverage` directory available. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see its output.

### 5.5. Dryrun

There is no new dryrun for iteration 3, however you can still run the dryrun for iteration 2. It consists of 4 tests, one each for your implementation of `clear/v1`, `auth/register/v2`, `channels/create/v2`, and `channels/list/v2`. These only check whether your server wrapper functions accept requests correctly, the format of your return types and simple expected behaviour, so do not rely on these as an indicator for the correctness of your implementation or tests.

To run the dryrun, you should be in the root directory of your project (e.g. `/project-backend`) and use the command:

```bash
1531 dryrun 2
```

To view the dryrun tests, you can run the following command on the CSE machines:  

```bash
cat ~cs1531/bin/iter2_test.py
```

### 5.6. Planning for the next problems to solve

Software development is an iterative process - we're never truly finished. As we complete the development and testing of one feature, we're often then trying to understand the requirements and needs of our users to design the next set of features in our product.

For iteration 3 you are going to produce a short report in `planning.pdf` and place it in the repository. The contents of this report will be a simplified approach to understanding user problems, developing requirements, and doing some early designs.

N.B. If you don't know how to produce a PDF, you can easily make one in Google docs and then export to PDF.

We have opted not to provide you with a sample structure - because we're not interested in any rigid structure. Structure it however you best see fit, as we will be marking content.

#### [Requirements] Elicitation

Find 2-3 people to interview as target users. Target users are people who currently use a tool like Treats, or intend to. Record their name and email address.

Develop a series of questions (at least 4) to ask these target users to understand what *problems* they might have with teamwork-driven communication tools that are currently unsolved by Treats. Give these questions to your target users and record their answers.

Once you have done this, think about how you would solve the target users' problem(s) and write down a brief description of a proposed solution.

#### [Requirements] Analysis & Specification - Use Cases

Once you've elicited this information, it's time to consolidate it.

Take the responses from the elicitation step and express these requirements as **user stories** (at least 3). Document these user stories. For each user story, add user acceptance criteria as notes so that you have a clear definition of when a story has been completed.

Once the user stories have been documented, generate at least ONE use case that attempts to describe a solution that satifies some of or all the elicited requirements. You can generate a visual diagram or a more written-recipe style, as per lectures.

#### [Requirements] Validation

With your completed use case work, reach out to the 2-3 people you interviewed originally and inquire as to the extent to which these use cases would adequately describe the problem they're trying to solve. Ask them for a comment on this, and record their comments in the PDF.

#### [Design] Interface Design

Now that we've established our _problem_ (described as requirements), it's time to think about our _solution_ in terms of what capabilities would be necessary. You will specify these capabilities as HTTP endpoints, similar to what is described in `6.2`. There is no minimum or maximum of what is needed - it will depend on what problem you're solving.

#### [Design] Conceptual Modelling - State Diagrams

Now that you have a sense of the problem to solve, and what capabilities you will need to provide to solve it, add at least ONE state diagram to your PDF to show how the state of the application would change based on user actions. The aim of this diagram is to help a developer understand the different states of the application.

### 5.7. Deployment

You and your team are to host your backend on a cloud provider. Once your backend has been deployed to the cloud, you will be able to point the frontend to use the new URL of where the backend is deployed and use your backend from anywhere in the world. In summary:
 * You get your server (that you wrote) deployed to the internet at a public URL
 * You still run your frontend locally (which can connect to that server)

Depending on how you and your team have structured your project, your current method of using data may have to be rethought. Deploying to cloud and developing locally require two different mindsets and you and your team may find that you held some assumptions that are valid when developing locally but do not hold when being hosted on the cloud.

We have written a guide on how to deploy to a free cloud provider <a href="https://www.alwaysdata.com/en/">AlwaysData</a>. [Click here to view the guide](docs/DEPLOY.md).

Note that if you choose to use a different cloud provider, your tutor will not be able to assist you.

You must add the URL to your deployed backend inside `deploy-url.md`.

The formula used for automarking in this iteration is:

`Mark = 95*(t * i * min(c + 1, 100)^3) + 5*e`
(Mark equals `t` multiplied by `i` multiplied by the minimum of `c + 1` and 100 to the power of three)

Where:
 * `t` is the mark you receive for your tests running against your code (100% = your implementation passes all of your tests).
 * `i` is the mark you receive for our course tests (hidden) running against your code (100% = your implementation passes all of our tests).
 * `c` is the score achieved by running coverage on your entire codebase. Note that 99% coverage is enough to give you full marks for this part.
 * `e` is the score between 0-1 achieved by running eslint against your code and the provided configuration.


### 5.9. Submission

This iteration due date described in section 7. Note there will be no demonstration for iteration 3.


### 5.10. Extra Features

Your tutor is not required to provide any assistance with this section, as it's intended for more advanced students once they complete all other criteria to a high standard.

A brief explanation of your additions must be written in a file <code>extra.md</code> that you need to add to your repo.

Here are some suggestions for extra features.

1. Frontend - **Hangman on Frontend**

    * After a game of Hangman has been started, any user in the channel can type "/guess X" where X is an individual letter. If that letter is contained in the word or phrase they're trying to guess, the app should indicate where it occurs. If it does not occur, more of the hangman is drawn. 
    
    * There is a lot of flexibility in how you achieve this. It can be done only by modifying the backend and relying on messages to communicate the state of the game (e.g. after making a guess, the "Hangman" posts a message with a drawing of the hangman in ASCII/emoji art). Alternatively, you can modify the frontend, if you want to experiment with fancier graphics.

    * The app should use words and phrases from an external source, not just a small handful hardcoded into the app. One suitable source is `/usr/share/dict/words` available on Unix-based systems

    * Note that this part of the specification is deliberately open-ended. You're free to make your own creative choices in exactly how the game should work, as long as the end result is something that could be fairly described as Hangman.

2. Frontend - **Dark Mode** - Modify the frontend code so that on the flip of a switch in the navbar, the website can change to "dark mode" with a colour scheme of your choosing.

3. Frontend - **LaTEX / Markdown Support** - Modify the frontend code so that messages in channels and DMs can be rendered in LaTEX and/or Markdown.

4. **Databases** - Implementing persistence using a form of database via `typeorm`.

7. **New Features** - Implement one or more of the features you have elicited in your Requirements & Design.

#### 6.2.3. Iteration 2 Interface

Changelog:
* Error returns should be converted to the respective Exception (see table below and section 6.8.2)
* All routes that require a `token` should raise a `403 Error` object when the `token` passed in is invalid.
* Instead of passing `token` as a query or body parameter, you should pass it through a HTTP header (see section 6.9):
  * You should remove `token` from query and body parameters for all routes.  
  * You also need to increment the version of each route that previously accepted `token` as a query or body parameter, e.g. v2 --> v3.  
* New error case for `channel/leave/v2`, added in table below.
* Added functionality for `message/edit/v2` in regards to standups, in table below.

Once you've concatenated it, if the handle is once again taken, append the concatenated names with the smallest number (starting from 0) that forms a new handle that isn't already taken. The addition of this final number may result in the handle exceeding the 20 character limit (the handle 'abcdefghijklmnopqrst0' is allowed if the handle 'abcdefghijklmnopqrst' is already taken).</td>

### 6.3. Valid email format

To check an email is valid, you may use the following package and function.

```javascript
import validator from 'validator';

validator.isEmail('foo@bar.com');
```

### 6.4. Testing

A common question asked throughout the project is usually "How can I test this?" or "Can I test this?" In any situation, most things can be tested thoroughly. However, some things can only be tested sparsely, and in some other rare occasions, some things can't be tested at all. A challenge of this project is for you to use your discretion to figure out what to test, and how much to test. Often, you can use functions you've already written to test new functions in a black-box manner.

### 6.5. Pagination

The behaviour in which channelMessages returns data is called **pagination**. It's a commonly used method when it comes to getting theoretially unbounded amounts of data from a server to display on a page in chunks. Most of the timelines you know and love - Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn - do this.

For example, in iteration 1, if we imagine a user with `authUserId` 12345 is trying to read messages from channel with ID 6, and this channel has 124 messages in it, 3 calls from the client to the server would be made. These calls, and their corresponding return values would be:
 * `channelMessages(12345, 6, 0) => { [messages], 0, 50 }`
 * `channelMessages(12345, 6, 50) => { [messages], 50, 100 }`
 * `channelMessages(12345, 6, 100) => { [messages], 100, -1 }`

Pagination should also apply to messages in DMs.

### 6.6. Permissions

 * Members in a channel/DM have one of two channel/DM permissions
   1) Owners of the channel/DM
   2) Members of the channel/DM
 * Treats users have two global permissions
   1) Owners (permission id 1), who can also modify other owners' permissions
   2) Members (permission id 2), who do not have any special permissions
* All Treats users are global members by default, except for the very first user who signs up, who is a global owner

A user's primary permissions are their global permissions. Then the channel/DM permissions are layered on top. For example:
* An owner of Treats has channel owner permissions in every channel they've joined. Despite obtaining owner permissions upon joining a channel, they do not become channel owners unless a channel owner explicitly adds them as one. Hence, if they are removed as a global owner, they will no longer have those channel owner permissions.
* Treats owners do not have owner permissions in DMs. The only users with owner permissions in DMs are the original creators of each DM.
* A member of Treats is a member in channels that they are part of but are not owners of
* A member of Treats is an owner in channels they are owners of

### 6.7. User Sessions

Iteration 2 introduces the concept of <b>sessions</b>. With sessions, when a user logs in or registers, they receive a "token" (think of it like a ticket to a concert). These tokens are stored on the web browser, and nearly every time that user wants to make a request to the server, they will pass this "token" as part of this request. In this way, the server is able to take this token, look at it (like checking a ticket), and figure out who the user is.

A token (to represent a session) for iteration 2 can be as simple a randomly generated number (converted to a string as per the interface specifications) and stored as one of many possible sessions against a specific user.

In this structure, this also means it's possible to "log out" a particular user's session without logging out other sessions. I.e. One user can log in on two different browser tabs, click logout on tab 1, but still functionally use the website on tab 2.

Don't worry about creating a secure method of session storage in iteration 2 - that is for iteration 3.

### 6.8. Working with the frontend

There is a SINGLE repository available for all students at https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1531/22T2/project-frontend. You can clone this frontend locally. If you'd like to modify the frontend repo (i.e. teach yourself some frontend), please FORK the repository.

If you run the frontend at the same time as your express server is running on the backend, then you can power the frontend via your backend.

Please note: The frontend may have very slight inconsistencies with expected behaviour outlined in the specification. Our automarkers will be running against your compliance to the specification. The frontend is there for further testing and demonstration.

#### 6.8.1. Example implementation

A working example of the frontend can be used at http://treats-unsw.herokuapp.com/. This is not a gospel implementation that dictates the required behaviour for all possible occurrences. Our implementation will make reasonable assumptions just as yours will, and they might be different, and that's fine.

The data is reset occasionally, but you can use this link to play around and get a feel for how the application should behave.

#### 6.8.2. Error raising

Either a `400 (Bad Request)` or `403 (Forbidden)` is thrown when something goes wrong. A `400` error refers to issues with user input, whereas a `403` error refers to issues with authorisation. All of these cases are listed in the **Interface** table. If input implies that both errors should be thrown, throw a `403` error.

One exception is that, even though it's not listed in the table, for all routes except `auth/register`, `auth/login`, `auth/passwordreset/request` and `auth/passwordreset/reset`, a `403` error is thrown when the token passed in is invalid.

For errors to be appropriately raised on the frontend, they must be thrown as follows:

```javascript
if (true) { // condition here
    throw HTTPError(403, "description")
}
```

The quality of the descriptions will not be assessed, but you must modify your errors to this format.

There has also been a middleware handler added to your `server.ts` file to take care of errors encountered. The `middleware-http-errors`[https://www.npmjs.com/package/middleware-http-errors] package is custom-made for COMP1531 students, used as follows:

```javascript
app.use(errorHandler());
```

### 6.9. Secure Sessions & Passwords

Passwords must be stored in an **encrypted** form.

You must **hash** tokens in iteration 3, and pass them through a custom `token` HTTP Header (rather than passing them plainly as `GET/DELETE` parameters).

In this model, you will replace `token` query and body parameters with a `token` HTTP header when dealing with requests only. You shouldn't remove `token` parameters from backend functions, as they must perform the validity checks.

You can access HTTP headers like so:
```javascript
const token = req.header('token');
```

A sample flow logging a user in might be as follows (other flows exist too):
1. Client makes a valid `auth/login` call
2. Server generates `token` and `hashOf(token+secret)`
3. Server returns the hash as the `token` value in the response's body.

A sample flow creating a channel might be as follows:
1. Client makes a valid `channel/create` call
2. Server gets `token` hash in th request's HTTP header
3. Server passes `token` hash to the relevant backend function to compare to the stored `token`, determining if it's a valid session.

**Why hash tokens?**
If we hash tokens (combined with a global secret) before storing them, and an attacker gets access to our backend of active sessions (i.e. our list of valid tokens), they won't be able to determine the client-side token (as they don't know the hash function or secret added to the token). 

**Why pass tokens as a HTTP header?**
Any query parameters (those used by `GET/DELETE` functions) can be read in plaintext by an eavesdropper spying on your HTTP requests. Hence, by passing an authentication token as a query parameter, we're allowing an attacker to intercept our request, steal our token and impersonate other users! On the other hand, HTTP headers are encrypted (as long as you use HTTPS protocol), meaning an eavesdropper won't be able to read token values.

While this safely protects sessions from server-side attacks (accessing our persistent data) and man-in-the-middle attacks (intercepting our HTTP requests), it doesn't protect against client-side attacks (stealing a token on the client-side, after the HTTP header has been decoded and received by the user). 

**You do not need to worry about mitigating client-side attacks**, but you can read more about industry-standard session management <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#secure-attribute">here</a>.


### 6.10. Notifications and tagging users

#### 6.10.1 Notifications

If an action triggering a notification has been 'undone' (e.g. a message has been unreacted, or a tagged message has been edited/removed), the original notification should not be affected and will remain.

A user should not be notified of any reactions to their messages if they are no longer in the channel/DM that the message was sent in.

#### 6.10.2 Tagging

A user is tagged when a message contains the @ symbol, followed immediately by the user‚Äôs handle. The end of the handle is signified by the end of the message, or a non-alphanumeric character. The message '`hi@handle`' contains a valid tag. '`@handle1@handle2 hello!`' contains two valid tags.

Some additional requirements are:
* If the handle is invalid, or the user is not a member of the channel or DM, no one is tagged.
* A user should be able to tag themselves.
* A message can contain multiple tags.
* If the same valid tag appears multiple times in one message, the user is only notified once.

Tagging should also occur when messages are edited to contain tags and when the message/share optional message contains tags.

There is no requirement to have tags notify users inside a standup or when the buffered standup messages are sent.

### 6.11. Analytics

COMP6080 students have implemented analytics pages for users and for the Treats workspace on the frontend, and now these pages need data. Your task is to add backend functionality that keeps track of these metrics:

For users:
  * The number of channels the user is a part of
  * The number of DMs the user is a part of
  * The number of messages the user has sent
  * The user's involvement, as defined by this pseudocode: `sum(numChannelsJoined, numDmsJoined, numMsgsSent)/sum(numChannels, numDms, numMsgs)`. If the denominator is 0, involvement should be 0. If the involvement is greater than 1, it should be capped at 1.

For the Treats workspace:
  * The number of channels that exist currently
  * The number of DMs that exist currently
  * The number of messages that exist currently
  * The workspace's utilization, which is a ratio of the number of users who have joined at least one channel/DM to the current total number of users, as defined by this pseudocode: `numUsersWhoHaveJoinedAtLeastOneChannelOrDm / numUsers`

As UNSW is very interested in its users' engagement, the analytics must be **time-series data**. This means every change to the above metrics (excluding `involvementRate` and `utilizationRate`) must be timestamped, rather than just the most recent change. For users, the first data point should be 0 for all metrics at the time that their account was created. Similarly, for the workspace, the first data point should be 0 for all metrics at the time that the first user registers. The first element in each array should be the first metric. The latest metric should be the last element in the array.

For users, the number of channels and DMs that they are a part of can increase and decrease over time, however the number of messages sent will only increase (the removal of messages does not affect it).

For the workspace, `numMsgs` is the number of messages that exist at the current time, and should decrease when messages are removed, or when `dm/remove` is called. Messages which have not been sent yet with `message/sendlater` or `message/sendlaterdm` are not included, and `standup/send` messages only count when the final packaged standup message from `standup/start` has been sent. `numChannels` will never decrease as there is no way to remove channels, and `numDms` will only decrease when `dm/remove` is called.

In addition to keeping track of these metrics, you are required to implement two new endpoints, `user/stats` and `users/stats`.

### 6.12. Reacts
The only React ID currently associated with the frontend is React ID 1, which is a thumbs up. You are welcome to add more (this will require some frontend work).

### 6.13. Standups
Once a standup is finished, all of the messages sent to `standup/send` are packaged together in *one single message* posted by *the user who started the standup*. This packaged message is sent as a message to the channel where the standup was started, timestamped at the moment the standup finished.

The structure of the packaged message is like this:

```txt
[messageSender1Handle]: [message1]
[messageSender2Handle]: [message2]
[messageSender3Handle]: [message3]
[messageSender4Handle]: [message4]
```

For example:

```txt
jake: I ate a catfish
hayden: I went to kmart
emily: I ate a toaster
nick: my catfish ate a kmart toaster
```

Standups can be started on the frontend by typing "/standup X" (where X is the number of seconds that the standup lasts for) into the message input and clicking send. E.g., to start a 90-second standup, type "/standup 90" and press send.

You will not be tested on any behaviour involving the user who started a standup being removed from the channel or Treats while the standup is ongoing, therefore you can decide this behaviour yourself.

### 6.14. profileImgUrl & image uploads
For outputs with data pertaining to a user, a `profileImgUrl` must be present. When images are uploaded for a user profile, after processing them you should store them on the server such that your server now locally has a copy of the cropped image of the original file linked. Then, the `profileImgUrl` should be a URL to the server, such as http://localhost:5001/imgurl/adfnajnerkn23k4234.jpg (a unique url you generate).

For any given user, if they have yet to upload an image, there should be a site-wide default image used.

Note: This is most likely the most challenging part of the project, so don't get lost in this. We would strongly recommend most teams complete this capability *last*.

## 7. Due Dates and Weightings

|Iteration|Due date                              |Demonstration to tutor(s)      |Assessment weighting of project (%)|
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|   0     |10pm Friday 10th June (**week 2**)    |No demonstration               |5%                                |
|   1     |10pm Friday 24th June  (**week 4**)   |In YOUR **week 5** laboratory  |30%                                |
|   2     |10pm Friday 15th July (**week 7**)    |In YOUR **week 8** laboratory  |35%                                |
|   3     |10pm Friday 5th August (**week 10**)  |No demonstration               |30%                                |

### 7.1. Submission & Late Penalties

There is no late penalty, as we do not accept late submissions. You will be assessed on the most recent version of your work at the due date and time.

To submit your work, open up a CSE terminal and run:

` $ 1531 submit [iteration] [groupname]`

For example:

` $ 1531 submit iteration1 W11A_EGGS`

Only one person per group needs to run this command. This will submit a copy of your latest git commit to our systems for automarking. Your tutor will also request you pull up this copy when marking you in the demonstration.

If the deadline is approaching and you have features that are either untested or failing their tests, **DO NOT MERGE IN THOSE MERGE REQUESTS**. In some cases, your tutor will look at unmerged branches and may allocate some reduced marks for incomplete functionality, but `master` should only contain working code.

Minor isolated fixes after the due date are allowed but carry a penalty if the mark after re-running the autotests is greater than your initial mark. This penalty equates to up to 30% of the automark for that iteration. Note that if the re-run automark after penalty is lower than your initial mark, we will keep your initial mark, meaning your automark cannot decrease after a re-run. E.g. if your initial mark is 50% and on re-run you get 70%, your mark may still be capped at 50%. If you want to have your automarking re-run, branch off the submission commit, make the necessary changes, and push them to another branch and share the name of the branch with your tutor.

### 7.2. Demonstration

For the demonstrations in weeks 5 and 8, all team members **must** attend this lab session, or they will not receive a mark. If you are unable to attend the session, you must apply for special consideration.

Demonstrations take place during lab time and consist of a 15 minute Q&A in front of your tutor and maybe some other students in your tutorial. For online classes, webcams are required to be on during this Q&A (your phone is a good alternative if your laptop/desktop doesn't have a webcam).

## 8. Individual Contribution

While we do award a tentative mark to your group as a whole, your actual mark for each iteration is given to you individually. Your individual mark is determined by your tutor, with your group mark as a reference point. Your tutor will look at the following items each iteration to determine your mark:
 * Project check-in
 * Code contribution
 * Tutorial contributions
 * Peer assessment

In general, all team members will receive the same mark (a sum of the marks for each iteration), **but if you as an individual fail to meet these criteria, your final project mark may be scaled down**, most likely quite significantly.

### 8.1. Project check-in

During your lab class, in weeks without project demonstrations, you and your team will conduct a short stand-up in the presence of your tutor. Each member of the team will briefly state what they have done in the past week, what they intend to do over the next week, and what issues they faced or are currently facing. This is so your tutor, who is acting as a representative of the client, is kept informed of your progress. They will make note of your presence and may ask you to elaborate on the work you've done.

Project check-ins are also excellent opportunities for your tutor to provide you with both technical and non-technical guidance.

Your attendance and participation at project check-ins will contribute to your individual mark component for the project.

These are easy marks. They are marks assumed that you will receive automatically, and are yours to lose if you neglect them.

### 8.2. Tutorial contributions

From weeks 2 onward, your individual project mark may be reduced if you do not satisfy the following:
* Attend all tutorials
* Participate in tutorials by asking questions and offering answers
* [online only] Have your web cam on for the duration of the tutorial and lab

We're comfortable with you missing or disengaging with 1 tutorial per term, but for anything more than that please email your tutor. If you cannot meet one of the above criteria, you will likely be directed to special consideration.

These are easy marks. They are marks assumed that you will receive automatically, and are yours to lose if you neglect them.

### 8.3. Code contribution

All team members must contribute code to the project to a generally similar degree. Tutors will assess the degree to which you have contributed by looking at your **git history** and analysing lines of code, number of commits, timing of commits, etc. If you contribute significantly less code than your team members, your work will be closely examined to determine what scaling needs to be applied.

Note that, **contributing code is not a substitute for not contributing more documentation**.

### 8.4. Documentation contribution

All team members must contribute documentation to the project to a generally similar degree.

In terms of code documentation, your functions such as `authRegister`, `channelInvite`, `messageSend`, etc. are also required to contain comments of the following format:

```
<Brief description of what the function does>

Arguments:
    <name> (<data type>)    - <description>
    <name> (<data type>)    - <description>
    ...

Return Value:
    Returns <return value> on <condition>
    Returns <return value> on <condition>
```

In each iteration you will be assessed on ensuring that every relevant function in the specification is appropriately documented.

In terms of other documentation (such as reports and other notes in later iterations), we expect that group members will contribute equally.

Note that, **contributing more documentation is not a substitute for not contributing code**.

### 8.5. Peer Assessment

At the end of each iteration, there will be a peer assessment survey where you will rate and leave comments about each team member's contribution to the project up until that point. 

Your other team members will **not** be able to see how you rated them or what comments you left in either peer assessment. If your team members give you a less than satisfactory rating, your contribution will be scrutinised and you may find your final mark scaled down.

### 8.6. Managing Issues

When a group member does not contribute equally, we are aware it can implicitly have an impact on your own mark by pulling the group mark down (e.g. through not finishing a critical feature), etc.

The first step of any disagreement or issue is always to talk to your team member(s) on the chats in MS teams. Make sure you've been:
1. Been clear about the issue you feel exists
2. Been clear about what you feel needs to happen and in what time frame to feel the issue is resolved
3. Gotten clarity that your team member(s) want to make the change.

If you don't feel that the issue is being resolved quickly, you should escalate the issue by talking to your tutor with your group in a project check-in, or alternatively by emailing your tutor privately outlining your issue.

It's imperative that issues are raised to your tutor ASAP, as we are limited in the mark adjustments we can do when issues are raised too late (e.g. we're limited with what we can do if you email your tutor with iteration 2 issues after iteration 2 is due).

## 9. Automarking & Leaderboard

### 9.1. Automarking

Each iteration consists of an automarking component. The particular formula used to calculate this mark is specific to the iteration (and detailed above).

When running your code or tests as part of the automarking, we place a 2.5 minute timer on the running of your group's tests. This is more than enough time to complete everything unless you're doing something very wrong or silly with your code. As long as your tests take under 2.5 minutes to run on the pipeline, you don't have to worry about it potentially taking longer when we run automarking.

### 9.2. Leaderboard

In the days preceding iterations 1, 2, and 3's due date, we will be running your code against the actual automarkers (the same ones that determine your final mark) and publishing the results of every group on a leaderboard. [The leaderboard will be available here once released](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/22T2/leaderboard).

The leaderboard will be run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday lunchtime during the week that the iteration is due.

Your position and mark on the leaderboard will be referenced against an alias for your group (for privacy). This alias will be emailed to your group in week 3. You are welcome to share your alias with others if you choose! (Up to you.)

The leaderboard gives you a chance to sanity check your automark (without knowing the details of what you did right and wrong), and is just a bit of fun.

If the leaderboard isn't updating for you, try hard-refreshing your browser (Ctrl+R or Command+R), clearing your cache, or opening it in a private window. Also note the HTTP (not HTTPS) in the URL, as the site is only accessible via HTTP.

## 10. Plagiarism

The work you and your group submit must be your own work. Submission of work partially or completely derived from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted. The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks, automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline. Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually for such submissions.

Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.

Do not provide or show your project work to any other person, except for your group and the teaching staff of COMP1531. If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any reason, and work derived from it is submitted you may be penalized, even if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent. This may apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.

Note, you will not be penalized if your work has the potential to be taken without your consent or knowledge.
