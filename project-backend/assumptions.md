Iteration 1: 
    - Assume that a user has to invited intially to be added as an owner (of channel)
    - Assume authuserId is a user requesting to use a specified function
    - Assume that channelsCreate will not add users and make them the owners of the channel
    - Assume that when a message is edited/changed the userId will not change
    - Assume that users will be able to see the private channels if they are to create one
    - Assume that testing done within iteration 1 is being run when the program is restarted (from start)
    - Assume password has no restrictions other than the paramater of being greater than 6
    - Assume end-time is based on the input of start
    - Assume handleStr can have a maximum of 20 characters and there are no specific restrictions on minimum
    - Assume if handleStr is the same, they had to be incremented sequentially
    - Assume that if there is only one member in a channel whi is the owner, the channel will stop (not exist) if the owner leaves the specific channel
    - Assume that there will always be one owner in a channel, so in order for an owner to leave there must be two ownners in channel 
    - Assume that users can have same firstName, lastName and password
    - Assume no names (first & last) contain numbers
    - Assume any member of a channel can invite another user, regardless if the channel is Public or not
    - Assume different channels can have the same name
    - Assume that channelId will always be a positive number
    - Assume password length is greater than 0

Assumptions selected for marking:
    - Assume no names (first & last) contain numbers
    - Assume any member of a channel can invite another user, regardless if the channel is Public or not
    - Assume different channels can have the same name
    - Assume that channelId will always be a positive number
    - Assume handleStr can have more than 20 characters (due to incrementation of duplicate handleStr) and there are no specific restrictions on minimum
    - Assume that there will always be one owner in a channel, so in order for an owner to leave there must be two ownners in channel
